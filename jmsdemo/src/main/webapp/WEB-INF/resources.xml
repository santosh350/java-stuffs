<!--
 This creates an ActiveMQ Broker that runs inside TomEE and is bound to the address someHostName:61616.
 This broker will start when TomEE starts and shutdown when TomEE shuts down. All JMS communication happening
  inside TomEE itself will happen using the embedded ActiveMQ Broker over the ActiveMQ "vm"
 transport which is optimized for sending and receiving messages when in the same JVM as the Broker.

Connecting to an External Broker
It is possible to connect to an ActiveMQ Broker running externally. The setup is similar to the above with only two changes.

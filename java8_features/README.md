NOTE:
=====

Heap Space:
The heap stores all of the objects created by your Java program.
The heap's contents is monitored by the garbage collector, which frees memory from the
heap when you stop using an object (i.e. when there are no more references to the object.

Stack:
Stack stores primitive types like ints and chars, and are typically local variables
and function return values. These are not garbage collected.

PermGen(MetaSpace):
The permanent generation is special because it holds meta-data describing user classes
classes that are not part of the Java language). Examples of such meta-data are objects describing
classes and methods and they are stored in the Permanent Generation. Applications with large code-base
can quickly fill up this segment of the heap which will cause java.lang.OutOfMemoryError:
PermGen no matter how high your -Xmx and how much memory you have on the machine.
